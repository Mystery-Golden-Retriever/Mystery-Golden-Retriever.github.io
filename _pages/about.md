# Welcome
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and ECE department of University of Southern California (USC). Prior to that, I completed my Master's degree in School of Electronic Science and Engineering, and my Bachelor's degree in Kuang Yaming Honors School (formerly Gifted Young Class), both from Nanjing University.


My research interests primarily focus on Efficient Deep Learning Algorithms, Machine Learning System, and Distributed Edge Computing. I am passionate about exploring new techniques and approaches to improve the performance and efficiency of deep learning models, making them more accessible and practical for real-world applications. I have published many papers at the top AI conferences with <strong><span id='total_cit'>72</span></strong></a> <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AQuXJEkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar citations.
