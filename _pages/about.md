# Welcome
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

<!---I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and ECE department of University of Southern California (USC). Prior to that, I completed my Master's degree in School of Electronic Science and Engineering, and my Bachelor's degree in Kuang Yaming Honors School (formerly Gifted Young Class), both from Nanjing University.


My research interests primarily focus on Efficient Deep Learning Algorithms, Machine Learning System, and Distributed Edge Computing. I am passionate about exploring new techniques and approaches to improve the performance and efficiency of deep learning models, making them more accessible and practical for real-world applications. I have published many papers at the top AI conferences with <strong><span id='total_cit'>72</span></strong></a> <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AQuXJEkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar citations.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and the ECE department of the University of Southern California (USC), advised by Prof. Stephen Crago. My dissertation research focuses on **Efficient and Trustworthy Distributed EdgeAI Systems in the Era of Large Language Models (LLM)**. 

Before joining USC, I completed my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering under Prof. Zhongfeng Wang (IEEE Fellow), and my Bachelor's degree in Physics from Kuang Yaming Honors School at Nanjing University.

My research interests span **Efficient Deep Learning Algorithms**, **Machine Learning Systems**, and **Distributed Edge Computing**. I am passionate about creating practical and efficient deep learning models and systems suitable for real-world applications. I have published papers in top AI conferences, accumulating **90** citations ([Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AQuXJEkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)).
